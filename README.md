# FrankPracticalApplication2
This is the second Practical Application for Berkeley Machine Learning Certificate Program



## Overview:

In this application, we will explore a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Our goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of our analysis, we should be able to provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

## Data:

The data set has 426k records and 18 features:

"id" : transaction id for vehicle sold

"region" : The region in which the vehicle was sold

"price" : The price the car was sold

"year": The manufacture year of the car

"manufacturer" : The manufacturer for the car

"model" : The car model

"condition" : The vehicle's condition when it was sold (nan, 'good', 'excellent', 'fair', 'like new', 'new', 'salvage')

"cylinders" : Size of the engine in each vehicle (nan, '8 cylinders', '6 cylinders', '4 cylinders', '5 cylinders', 'other', '3 cylinders', '10 cylinders', '12 cylinders')

"fuel" : The fuel type the vehicle takes (nan, 'gas', 'other', 'diesel', 'hybrid', 'electric')

"odometer" : The number of km/miles the vehicle has.

"title_status" : The type of status of the vehicle (nan, 'clean', 'rebuilt', 'lien', 'salvage', 'missing', 'parts only')

"transmission" : The transmission type of the vehicle (nan, 'other', 'automatic', 'manual')

"VIN" : Vehicle identification number

"drive" : Type of vehicle traction (nan, 'rwd', '4wd', 'fwd')

"size" : Vehicle size (nan, 'full-size', 'mid-size', 'compact', 'sub-compact')

"type" : Type of vehicle (nan, 'pickup', 'truck', 'other', 'coupe', 'SUV', 'hatchback', 'mini-van', 'sedan', 'offroad', 'bus', 'van', 'convertible', 'wagon')

"paint_color" : The vehicle color

"state" : State in which the transaction took place

## Analysis:

Based on the analysis to the dataset, it is determined that how old is the car is the  most important factor that determines the used car price.  The next important factor is the milage the car has.  This seems fitting to our normal held common sense.
